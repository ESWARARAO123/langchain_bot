Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain with Google Colab, where the code uses a state graph to interact with the ChatGroq model (Gemma2-9b-It). The project sets up a simple chatbot flow that allows continuous interaction with the model, enabling real-time conversation via a defined graph.

Key Features:
LangChain: An orchestration framework used to manage and route prompts to language models.
ChatGroq: A large language model interface used to generate responses.
StateGraph: A graph-based structure to define the chatbot's flow.
Google Colab Integration: Environment setup using userdata to securely manage API keys and other sensitive information.
Prerequisites:
Google Colab: This setup is designed to run in Google Colab. Ensure you have access to Google Colab and are familiar with Python environments.
LangChain & LangGraph: You will need to have both LangChain and LangGraph installed in your environment.
Setup:
Install Required Packages: Install the required libraries, such as langchain, langgraph, and langchain_groq, in your Colab notebook environment. These libraries help interact with the LLM (Large Language Model) and handle state graphs.


pip install langchain langgraph langchain_groq
Configure Environment Variables: The code retrieves environment variables from the userdata of Colab to securely pass sensitive information such as API keys.

groc_key: API key for ChatGroq.
LANGSMITH_API_KEY: Used for LangSmith.
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2: Enables tracing of model operations.
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT: Defines the name of the project for tracking purposes.
Ensure you have these keys available or replace the placeholders with actual values.

Define Chatbot Graph:

A StateGraph is used to model the flow of the chatbot interaction.
The chatbot function invokes the ChatGroq model using the messages passed from the user.
Run the Code: The while loop provides continuous interaction between the user and the chatbot until the user enters "quit" or "q".


while True:
    user_input = input("user:  ")
    if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "q"]:
        print("good bye")
        break
    for event in graph.stream({"messages":("user",user_input)}):
        print(event.values())
        for value in event.values():
            print(value['messages'])
            print("assistant:",value["messages"].content)

Running the Bot
Run the script inside your Google Colab environment.
When prompted, enter your message in the input field to interact with the chatbot.
The conversation will continue until you type quit or q to exit.
Error Handling
The script contains an exception block to handle errors in graph rendering:
python

from IPython.display import Image, display
try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except:
    pass
This ensures that if the graph visualization fails, the code continues executing.
Future Improvements
Add more complex graph interactions or chain multiple nodes to handle different types of chatbot flows.
Implement additional error handling or model-fallback mechanisms.
Integrate more models or expand the use of LangSmith for enhanced monitoring.
